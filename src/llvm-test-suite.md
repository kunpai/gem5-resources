# LLVM Test Suite

The LLVM test suite is a collection of tests that are used to validate the
correctness of the LLVM compiler.
This document describes some commands that can be used to compile the suite.

## Obtaining the LLVM test suite

The LLVM test suite can be cloned from the official repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite.git
```

## Building the LLVM test suite on a native system

On a native system, the LLVM test suite can be compiled using the following:

```bash
cmake . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles" -DTEST_SUITE_COLLECT_CODE_SIZE=OFF -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-static" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES=".a"
```
This command uses the `cmake` command to generate a build system for the LLVM test suite.
The `-DTEST_SUITE_COLLECT_CODE_SIZE=OFF` flag is used to disable the collection of code size information.
The `-DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-static"` flag is used to link the executables statically.
The `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` flag is used to build the LLVM test suite without shared libraries.
The `-DCMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES=".a"` flag is used to search for static libraries.

To build a specific test, use the following command:

```bash
cmake --build build --target <test_name>
```
where `<test_name>` is the name of the test that you want to build.

For example, to build the `MultiSource/Applications/minisat` test, use the following command:

```bash
cmake --build build --target minisat
```

For more information about the LLVM test suite, please refer to the [official documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStartedTutorials.html).

## Cross-compiling the LLVM test suite

To cross-compile the LLVM test suite, you will need to run a different `cmake` command that specifies the cross-compiler.

For example, to cross-compile the LLVM test suite for the RISC-V architecture, use the following command:

```bash
cmake . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles" -DTEST_SUITE_COLLECT_CODE_SIZE=OFF -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-static" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES=".a" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=riscv64-linux-gnu-g++
```

This command is similar to the previous command, but it specifies the RISC-V cross-compiler using the `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flags.

To build a specific test for the RISC-V architecture, the command is the same as before:

```bash
cmake --build build --target <test_name>
```
where `<test_name>` is the name of the test that you want to build.
